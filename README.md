# docker_images
Docker images used at LASA. Each folder contains a separate docker images. To build the images, ensure that you have docker set up and running (see [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/)) and run the build script:

```
sh build.sh
```

For some images, you might need to specify which branch you want to pull. In this case run as follow:

```
sh build.sh myBranch
```
